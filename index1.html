   <h1>My Web Hosting Journey</h1>
   <h3>VOL. 1</h3> 
    <p>I have always dreamed of knowing how the tech world works and its connection with the human life. I begun my journey in the coding world with the help of Freecode camp. 
    Freecode camp gave me an introductiuon to the world of website design and application. They provided an interesting layout on my improvement by breaking down complex lessons into simple and understandable ones. 
    The beginning of my journey was as every study goes, smooth and fun, but with time i got to learn that all the lessons were application of the previous ones. This made me see and understand the beauty of web design. I appreciated it and motivated me to continue my studies.
    <p>I have determination but there are some rough roads a man has to go through. I faced internet connection challenges since the platform consumes much data and requires a stable connection.
    This made my interest drop a bit but because of who i envisioned myself to be i had to keep going.
    i had to travel from my residence to another town with stable internet connection just to continue my studies.
    i remember one time i accidentally dropped my PC in the vehicle which caused the screen to crack.</p>
